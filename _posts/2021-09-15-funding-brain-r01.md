### Map Manager: Longitudinal image analysis with online editing and sharing.

A major bottleneck in the interpretation of longitudinal imaging data is the availability of useful analysis software tools. The purpose of this proposal is to develop a rigorous and easy to use software ecosystem for the annotation, curation, and sharing of longitudinal imaging datasets. We will provide cloud-based editors and viewers that allow collaboration and dissemination of this critical data.
