### Please see our [Jobs](/jobs/) page for more information.

We are hiring for multiple positions including two Graduate Students and a Junior Specialist. All positions are funded by the [NIH BRAIN initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/).

Successful candidates will join a growing team developing image analysis algorithms and visualization software to provide desperately needed tools for the analysis of a range of neuroscience data. This includes large-scale in vivo 3D imaging with two-photon microscopy and 'wearable' mini-scopes. Current datasets are examining neuronal spine and axon dynamics as well as Ca++ signaling with GCaMP.
