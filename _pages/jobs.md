## Undergraduates

We are recruiting undergraduates to join our team. We have a number of exciting projects which give an opportunity for learning, training, and independent research. We are interested and welcome students from a range of majors including biology, engineering, computer science, and statistics.

## Searching for 2 Graduate Students and a  Junior Specialist to join our team.

We are currently recruiting two Graduate Students and a Junior Specialist. All positions are funded by the [NIH BRAIN initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/).

Successful candidates will join a growing team to develop image analysis algorithms and visualization software to provide critically needed tools for the greater neuroscience community. The data we are working with comes from a number of collaborators labs and includes large-scale <I>in vivo</I> 3D imaging with two-photon microscopy and 'wearable' mini-scopes. We are examining a range of datasets from neuronal spine and axon dynamics to Ca<sup>++</sup> signaling with GCaMP.

Our approach to designing this analysis software is to first create back-end computational engines in **Python**. We then implement multiple front-end graphical-user-interfaces (GUIs) including desktop and cloud versions. For the desktop GUIs we are using the [Qt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) framework. For the cloud (browser) versions we are using front-end Javascript frameworks such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Finally, we are developing pipelines such that our users can easily upload/browse/annotate their datasets on the web using [Amazon S3 storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and the NIH BRAIN funded [Brain-Imaging-Library](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/).

We have begun laying the groundwork for this exciting project. To get a taste of what we are doing, please see our [documentation](https://cudmore.github.io/PyMapManager/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cudmore/PyMapManager). There is still a ton of fun, creative, and collaborative work to be done.

Successful candidates will be involved in all aspects of the project from the ground up including:

 - Python code development
 - Desktop and web based GUI design
 - Conference presentations
 - Preparing and publishing manuscripts
 - Interacting with our collaborators to ensure we build useful and cutting-edge tools.
