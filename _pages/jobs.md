# We are currently hiring.

We are currently recruiting two Graduate Students and a Junior Specialist. All positions are funded by the [NIH BRAIN initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/).

Successful candidates will join a growing team to develop image analysis algorithms and visualization software to provide critically needed tools for the greater neuroscience community. The data we are working with comes from a number of collaborators labs and includes large-scale in vivo 3D imaging with two-photon microscopy and 'wearable' mini-scopes. We are examining a range of datasets from neuronal spine and axon dynamics to Ca<sup>++</sup> signaling with GCaMP.

Our approach to designing this analysis software is to create robust back-end computational engines in Python. We are implementing multiple front-end graphical-user-interfaces (GUIs)  including desktop and cloud version. For the cloud (web-based) versions we are using front-end Javascript frameworks such as Vue, React, and Angular. Finally, we are developing pipelines such that our users can easily upload/browse/annotate their datasets on the web.

We have begun laying the groundwork for this exciting project. To get a taste of what we are doing, please see our [documentation](https://cudmore.github.io/PyMapManager/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cudmore/PyMapManager). There is still a ton of fun, creative, and collaborative work to be done.

Successful candidates will be involved in all aspects of the project from Python code development to desktop and web based GUI design to conference presentations to preparing and publishing manuscripts. Finally, we will be interacting with our collaborators to get feedback to ensure we build useful and cutting-edge tools.
