I've been at UC Davis as an Assistant Professor since 2019. My initial training was in engineering and computer science. I was super happy to discover experimental biology research, in particular neuroscience and got a PhD with [Gina Turrigiano](https://blogs.brandeis.edu/turrigianolab/) at Brandeis University. After working with whole-cell electrophysiology through my graduate training and the initial phase of my post-doc, I discovered laser-scanning microscopy and got bitten by the imaging bug. I am particularly interested in developing new technologies including software and microscope hardware to address fundamental questions in biology. Currently, I am focused on building a lab.
